        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        A talented, passionate and hardworking artist who has a long record of accomplishment of creating original pieces of artwork through a variety of mediums. I have a strong artistic background, with a history of excellent artisanship; my priority is always customer needs and satisfaction.
        I work hard to stay current with the latest artistic tools and technologies. I am currently completing the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> with <strong>Algonquin College</strong> and have my background <em>Bachelor of Fine Art</em> in 1998 at <strong>Islamic Azad University</strong>.

        An image of a community is an important part of how we identify, share, and remember traditions and trends through generations. An image in a photograph tells a story through captured moments, giving life to days gone by and shaping how we perceive history. Explore our photographic past and experience how itâ€™s influenced our present. My artworks explore the relationship between Traditional sensibilities and modernization. With influences as diverse as authentic and historical, new combinations are generated from both implicit and explicit discourse. My artworks are the narrator of moments around our own life. In my works, there is an element of search in the socio-cultural /traditional domain with a subtle cultural and artistic flavor. I have a bent for enveloping the artistic concepts in layers of glamour, fantasy, sometimes in a dramatic fashion and traditional, and sometimes in a direct way as in a social science study. Finally, traditional and modern in my paintings are in my ways of expression.
